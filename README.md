Mobile Device & Prediction of Usage Patterns 📱🔍
This project focuses on analyzing mobile device usage metrics (such as app usage time, screen-on time, and battery drain) and predicting these metrics using various regression models. The goal is to understand user behavior based on these features and make accurate predictions for future usage.

Project Overview
Mobile devices generate vast amounts of data regarding how users interact with them. By analyzing this data, we can predict usage patterns, which can help in resource optimization and enhancing user experience. This project uses several regression techniques to predict key metrics of mobile device usage based on features like age, gender, and app usage patterns.

Key Features 📊
App Usage Time: Daily time spent on mobile applications (in minutes).
Screen-On Time: Average hours per day the screen is active.
Battery Drain: Daily battery consumption (in mAh).
Number of Apps Installed: Total number of apps installed on the device.
Data Usage: Daily mobile data consumption (in megabytes).
Demographic Information: User age and gender.
Models Used 🧠
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Evaluation Metrics 📏
The models are evaluated using the following metrics to measure performance:

R² Score: Measures how well the regression predictions fit the actual data.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
Tools & Libraries 🛠️
Python
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization of distributions and model performance.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
XGBoost: Gradient boosting model for regression.
